	  				I am obsessed with this game called Puzzle and Dragons (PAD); it's currently the top grossing mobile game in Japan, so you should check it out. It's a puzzle based adventure with dungeons you have to beat and powerful monsters from a rare gacha. I liken it a lot to my favorite childhood game, Pokemon due to the collection aspect. I convinced many of my friends to play, wrote an essay on it, so it's no surprise that I also made an Chrome extension to increase my efficiency in consuming related material.

	  				I often find myself having to use Google/Facebook to access related websites to look up information such as the alternating dungeon schedules and read analyzations about a possible new meta. Then I asked myself

	  				I do a lot of random design work for friends, and one of the projects I contributed to that I find particularly useful is this all in one web page that aggregates the world news, dinner menu, weather, and up to date bus information. I often find myself using it on my phone to check the weather or the bus times because it loads much faster and provides much more helpful information than MIT's mobile application. I also discovered the wonderful world of

	  				Sophomore year IAP: New York was cold, I was bored, and for some reason, I decided to embark on the journey of actually designing/creating my own website to showcase some of my art. I spent a lot of time playing around with creating websites, but I never finished a project. Mainly, I just wanted to figure out how all the cool single page websites that had parallax scrolling and fixed headers worked.
	  			</p>
	  			<p>
	  				In the end, I barely used any parallax scrolling; it made my website look a little too busy. I spent most of my time playing around with javascript libraries and figuring out what I could do. I pulled many almost all-nighters debugging my Javascript, changing the layout of the website, and designing the graphics. Fluid layouts are hard.

	  				 Looking back at it now, I'm kind embarrassed by my hacky code and design. I didn't really have a plan beforehand for how I wanted it look like, so I kind of just threw it all together. But I'm still pretty proud, this was my first big personal project, and I learned so much more than I would have expected. I didn't have any experience with Javascript prior to that point, and it took copious amounts of googling and trips to Stack Overflow to figure out how to do things and why my code wasn't working. After this project, I definitely advanced from Javascript newbie to a Javascript amateur. Having a finished product just makes it all the more satisfying.
